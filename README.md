PiZ-Screws
==========
A screw-terminal 'pHAT' for the Raspberry Pi Zero

The PiZ-Screws is a self-assembly screw-terminal adapter for the Raspberry Pi Zero
    * On-board 5V power supply to power the Raspberry Pi Zero from a 6V to 7.2V battery or power supply
    * Screw terminal for every GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi
    * on-board GPIO driven LED
    
No software needed - just assemble the board and you're ready to go!

The screw terminals are labeled according to the 'BCM' GPIO number.

Note that there is only one 0V / GND terminal (we'll be adding another in a later version...)
So you'll need to use the 0V / GND terminal for the power supply.



We don't yet have any assembly instructions for this board, it's brand new and there's not many out there yet...
If you have one then you probably got it in a prize bag for PiWars 2019 - congratulations & well done!!!

The assembly is pretty self explanitory but we'll write some instructions soon.

Please take a look at the instructions for the PiZ-Moto+ as these will provide some helpful notes.
